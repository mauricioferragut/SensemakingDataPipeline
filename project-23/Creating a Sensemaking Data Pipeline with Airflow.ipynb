    "## Abstract\n",
    "The overarching goal of the project is to make sense of unstructured MIT course catalog data downloaded from the University website and structure it by creating a sensemaking data pipeline which counts word frequency in course titles. The project breaks down the process of making the data pipeline into discrete tasks and uses Airflow to automate each of the tasks. The goal for the project is to run the tasks end to end without needing any human intervention to extract and make sense of the data. Once the pipeline is complete, the data is visualized in word bubbles utilizing the D3 library.\n"

    "\n",
    "The data used for this project comes from the MIT course catalog. The data pipeline process is broken down into discrete tasks in a python script which is then utilized to create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in Apache Airflow, where the pipeline is executed. \n"

    "## 2. Data Pipeline Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python script for this DAG can be found in the same repository this notebook is located in, within 'airflow-docker/dags/assignment.py'. The following is a conceptual explanation of the discrete tasks the pipeline is broken down into.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 0: Ensure beautifulsoup4 library is installed\n",
    "This task runs the bash command 'pip install beautifulsoup4', which task 3 depends upon to parse the HTML data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Pull Catalogs\n",
    "The first step in the pipeline is to iterate through the list of course catalog URLs, pull the course catalogs from the MIT website, read each file, and write the contents of each file to the local machine. The files are named after the URL they came from (Ex. m1a.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Combine Unstructured Data\n",
    "The second step in the pipeline is to combine all the unstructured data files from task 1 into one large file by iterating through files ending in .html and writing the contents of those files into a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Parse Out Course Titles\n",
    "The third step in the pipeline is to parse out the course titles from the HTML data. This is accomplished using the BeautifulSoup library to parse throught the HTML and find all information contained within \\<h3> tags, which is where course titles are located. This data is then appended to a 'titles' list, which is stored as a .json file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4: Clean the Course Titles\n",
    "The fourth step in the pipeline is to remove all punctuation, numbers, one-character words, and other common words such as 'and, of, to, in, the' from the titles.json file. The cleaned titles are stored into a 'titles_clean.json' document. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 5: Count Word Frequency\n",
    "The fifth and final step in the pipeline is to count word frequencies. Once the frequencies are counted, the data is stored into a 'words.json' document which containes each unique word and its associated frequency."
